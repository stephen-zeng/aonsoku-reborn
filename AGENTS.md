# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents when working with code in this
repository.

## Project Overview

Aonsoku is a multi-runtime music streaming client for Navidrome/Subsonic
servers. It targets the web, Electron and Tauri desktop, and Capacitor
iOS/Android. It
supports synchronized lyrics, radio streaming, Discord RPC, offline
library/cache features, and cross-device coordination with remote control and
handoff.

## Architecture Change Hygiene

When changing the architecture, runtime support, data flow, build commands, or
major module ownership, update `AGENTS.md` in the same change. In particular,
keep these sections current when adding or removing platforms, native capabilities,
background services, state stores, sync paths, or test/build commands.

## Architecture

### Multi-Target Build

- **Web**: Vite (`vite.config.ts`) builds `src/` as a standard SPA.
- **Electron**: `electron.vite.config.ts` builds `electron/main`,
  `electron/preload`, and the renderer, which reuses `src/`. A second,
  Electron-only renderer entry `electron/renderer/native-debug/index.html`
  builds the native player debug window (see Multi-Stack Native Playback); it
  is not part of the shared `src/` SPA, so web/Capacitor builds never bundle
  it. `tailwind.config.js` scans `electron/renderer/**` for its utility
  classes, and `tsconfig.electron-renderer.json` type-checks it.
- **Tauri**: reuses the Vite renderer and hosts native desktop playback,
  media-session, window, and audio-cache commands under `src-tauri/`. Tauri
  does not expose the Electron preload bridge; Electron-only UI and APIs must
  use `hasElectronBridge()` rather than the broader `isDesktop()` check.
- **Capacitor iOS/Android**: `capacitor.config.ts` points native hosts at
  `dist`. The custom native plugin lives in
  `capacitor-plugins/capacitor-native` and is included through pnpm workspace
  package `@aonsoku/capacitor-native`.
- Platform/runtime detection is centralized in `src/utils/capabilities.ts`,
  with lower-level helpers in `src/utils/desktop.ts` and
  `src/utils/platform.ts`.

### State Management

Two complementary systems:

- **Zustand** (`src/store/`) — client state with `immer`, `persist`,
  `devtools`, and `subscribeWithSelector` middleware. The player store is now
  modularized under `src/store/player/`; `src/store/player.store.ts` is mainly
  a compatibility export surface.
- **TanStack React Query** (`src/queries/`) — server/native data reads,
  caching, and invalidation. Query client configuration lives in
  `src/lib/queryClient.ts` with refetch-on-window-focus disabled.

Persistent browser-side library/cache data uses Dexie in `src/store/library-db.ts`
and IndexedDB helpers in `src/store/idb.ts`. Offline-capable UI paths generally
go through `src/lib/offlineQueryClient.ts`, which tries IDB/native data before
network when an offline function is available.

Playback state restore is owned by the runtime that owns playback. When the
native playback backend is active (`shouldUseNativePlaybackBackend()`, i.e.
Capacitor iOS/Android or Electron with the desktop native-audio bridge), the
native layer is the single source of truth for the restored queue and progress:
`src/store/player/persistence.ts` skips the renderer-side IDB songlist rehydrate
so `syncFromNative()` (`src/player/queue-controller/native-controller.ts`) sees an
empty renderer songlist, takes the cold-start branch, sets
`nativeDrivenTransition`, and the `AudioSrcChange` effect in
`src/app/components/player/audio.tsx` skips re-issuing `load()`. The Electron
main process restores position itself in
`electron/main/native/audio/service.ts` `#restorePlaybackState()` (persisted via
`playback-state.json`). Desktop writes are coordinated asynchronously outside
the playback-command FIFO: full-state changes use a 500ms debounce, progress
uses a 5s/meaningful-change throttle, and the store serializes atomic temporary
file replacements so older writes cannot overwrite newer state. Clear cancels
pending work before removing the file, while queue-transaction rollback and
service/app shutdown flush the latest snapshot; persistence failures remain
isolated from playback. The desktop singleton defers restore until
`setupDesktopNativeAudioIpc()` installs its stream/download/artwork resolvers
and calls the service's idempotent `ready()` lifecycle, so a restored uncached
`aonsoku-media://stream` source is translated before libmpv loads it. The
web/Electron-fallback path still rehydrates the songlist from IDB and drives
`load()` + `pendingResumePosition` from the renderer.

### Sync Architecture

Metadata/library sync is runtime-specific:

- **Web**: `src/service/cache/sync-worker-adapter.ts` creates
  `src/service/cache/sync.worker.ts` and communicates with it via Comlink.
  The worker owns its own Dexie instance, receives auth via
  `initAuth`/`updateAuth`, and bridges sync state/query invalidation back to
  the main thread.
- **Worker fallback**: if Web Workers are unavailable, sync falls back to
  `src/service/cache/metadata-sync.ts` on the main thread.
- **Electron, Capacitor iOS/Android**: sync uses
  `src/native/data/native-sync-adapter.ts` and the runtime's
  `AonsokuNativeData` implementation. Electron implements the bridge in
  `electron/main/native/data/`; mobile uses the Capacitor plugin. Native
  runtimes do not fall back to the browser Worker/IndexedDB sync path.

### Data Flow

```text
Subsonic/Navidrome server
  -> src/api/httpClient.ts / src/api/nativeHttpClient.ts
  -> src/service/*.ts or src/native/* facades
  -> src/queries/*.ts and src/lib/offlineQueryClient.ts
  -> React components
```

For native runtimes, album/song search and list queries may read through
`AonsokuNativeData` instead of directly calling Subsonic services. When changing
library data behavior, check the online service path, IDB/offline path, and
native data facade.

Electron follows the same renderer/native ownership boundary as Capacitor:

- Renderer code calls the shared native bridge, data, audio, and coordination
  facades. It must not open Subsonic/coordination HTTP or WebSocket connections.
- `electron/main/native/bridge/` owns credentials, login, server probing, and
  generic Subsonic requests.
- `electron/main/native/data/` owns metadata sync, persistent library queries,
  lyrics metadata, and cover/avatar downloads.
- `electron/main/native/preferences/` owns Electron desktop preference
  persistence exposed through `AonsokuNativePreferences`; renderer-side
  Zustand/UI preference stores should use `src/store/native-storage.ts` instead
  of adding new Electron renderer `localStorage` persistence.
- `electron/main/native/coordination/` owns coordination HTTP, token/config
  persistence, and the realtime WebSocket.
- `electron/main/native/media-protocol.ts` resolves renderer-facing
  `aonsoku-media://` cover/avatar/stream identifiers and injects credentials in
  the main process. Renderer code must not construct authenticated server URLs.
  The image proxy (`getCoverArt`/`getAvatar`) is bounded by a main-process
  `AsyncLimiter` (`electron/main/native/concurrency.ts`, concurrency 6), serves
  disk-cached covers first via `DesktopNativeDataService.readCoverWithMeta`
  (skipping the network when the cached copy is at least the requested size),
  and applies a 15s stall timeout (`AbortSignal.any([request.signal,
  AbortSignal.timeout(15_000)])`). `stream` stays on Node's default global
  `fetch` (no body timeout, so buffered-playout backpressure never aborts it);
  it is separated from the image flood because images/metadata no longer use
  the default agent. Bridge `downloadBinary`/`performRequest` and the
  `media-protocol` image proxy go through a dedicated undici `Agent`
  (`electron/main/native/bridge/http-agent.ts`, 16 connections per origin,
  `headersTimeout`/`bodyTimeout` set) via `subsonicFetch`, so image and
  metadata traffic shares one raised connection ceiling instead of saturating
  Node's default low-limit global pool and starving IPC handlers.

### Cross-Device Coordination

Aonsoku includes a Rust coordination service in `coordination-server/` for
device registration, presence, playback snapshots, remote control, history
sync, and handoff. The client-side orchestration lives in `src/coordination/`
with React state in `src/coordination/store.ts`.

- Web uses the TypeScript WebSocket client (`src/coordination/wsClient.ts`).
- Electron, iOS, and Android use `src/native/coordination/facade.ts` and their
  runtime-native coordination implementations.
- The root app mounts `CoordinationObserver`, and player/fullscreen/lyrics
  surfaces can project remote playback through
  `src/app/components/remote-control/`.

When changing playback controls, queue semantics, lyrics timing, scrobbling, or
handoff behavior, check local playback, remote-control projection, and native
coordination behavior together.

### Routing

React Router v6 uses hash routing (data router via `createHashRouter` in
`src/routes/router.tsx`). Route constants live in
`src/routes/routesList.ts`. Auth is enforced via loaders
(`protectedLoader.ts`, `loginLoader.ts`) — always use named route constants from
`ROUTES` rather than hardcoded strings.

The base layout's page outlet (`src/app/layout/main.tsx`) uses
`KeepAliveOutlet` (`src/app/layout/keep-alive-outlet.tsx`) instead of a plain
`<Outlet />`. Previously-visited route subtrees are kept mounted but hidden
(`display: none`) and toggled back to `display: contents` when revisited, so
returning to a page (especially the pinned home page) instantly shows the
already-loaded cover-art images and preserved component state instead of
re-fetching/re-mounting. To keep cached pages correct while hidden, each cached
subtree is re-wrapped in a frozen `UNSAFE_LocationContext.Provider` holding the
location it had when last active; the per-route `RouteContext` (params/matches)
is already embedded in the element returned by `useOutlet()`. Freezing only
`LocationContext` is sufficient because no cached page subtree reads volatile
global data-router state (`useMatches`/`useNavigation`/`useNavigationType` are
only used outside the cached outlet, e.g. in the header). Scroll position is
saved per cached route and restored on return; fresh pages scroll to the top
(this replaces the old route-change `scrollPageToTop` effect in `main.tsx`).
`KeepAliveOutlet` is configured with `exclude={["error"]}` and `pin={["home"]}`
and an LRU cap; when adding new routes that must always remount, add their id to
`exclude`, and avoid `useSearchParams`/`useLocation`/`useMatch` reading the live
location from inside a cached subtree unless the freeze above is extended.

### Component Patterns

- Radix UI primitives + shadcn/ui copy-paste pattern (full ownership of
  component code).
- `src/app/components/` — reusable UI components.
- `src/app/pages/` — route-level page components.
- `src/app/tables/` — data table implementations.
- Root observers live in `src/app/observers/` and are mounted in `App.tsx`.
  They include theme/lang/media session, native auth/remote commands, Android
  back button handling, metadata sync, coordination, network monitoring, and
  smart downloads.

### Styling

Tailwind CSS uses CSS custom properties for layout dimensions
(`--header-height`, `--sidebar-width`, `--player-height`, safe-area variables,
etc.). Theme variables (HSL colors for dark/light) are in `src/themes.css`.
Dark mode is class-based.

### Code Splitting

Normal Web (`pnpm run build`) and Electron renderer builds use
`manual-chunks.ts` to preserve the established larger `pages`, `core-vendor`,
and `heavy-vendor` bundles. Capacitor builds use `pnpm run build:mobile`
(`vite --mode mobile`), which leaves chunk ownership to Rollup so lazy modules
stay separate instead of collapsing every page and dependency into startup
chunks. Android/iOS CI and release workflows must use `build:mobile` before
`cap sync`; do not use the normal Web build for a native package.

The HTML boot shell and its inline styles load without the application
stylesheet; `src/main.tsx` restores native preferences before dynamically
importing `src/render-app.tsx`, which owns the application styles and React
tree. When adding large dependencies or moving substantial lazy-loaded feature
areas, verify both build modes: the normal Web output should retain the named
large chunks, while the mobile `dist/index.html` should not preload optional
route chunks or application CSS.

## Tooling Notes

- **Package manager**: pnpm only.
- **Workspace**: root app plus `capacitor-plugins/*`.
- **Linter/formatter**: Biome 2.0.6 — double quotes, trailing commas,
  80-character line width, no unused vars/imports.
- **TypeScript**: strict mode, path alias `@/` -> `src/`.
- **Rust**: coordination server is a separate Cargo project under
  `coordination-server/`.
- **Native**: Android host lives under `android/`; iOS host lives under `ios/`;
  shared Capacitor plugin source lives under
  `capacitor-plugins/capacitor-native/`.
- **Git hooks**: Husky is configured (`.husky/`) and pre-commit runs
  `pnpm lint`.

## Commit Message Format

`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

- **type** (required): feat, fix, refactor, test, chore, i18n
- **scope** (optional): a parenthesized area of the codebase, e.g. (queue),
  (cache), (i18n), (fullscreen), (settings), (header), (user-dropdown)
- **subject**: a concise, lowercase imperative description without a trailing
  period. For fix commits, it often explains the problem solved; for feat, what
  was added.

Examples:

- feat(cache): add global AudioCacheQueue with priority scheduling
- fix: robust service worker update detection
- refactor(user-dropdown): reorder menu and remove sync controls
- test: add and improve vitest tests for sync/cache modules
- chore: bump to v0.30.0

The scope is omitted when the change is cross-cutting or does not fit a
specific area. This follows the Conventional Commits convention.

## Multi-Stack Native Playback

The project implements a unified playback abstraction layer (`PlaybackBackend`
interface) supporting multiple playback stacks:

| Stack | Runtime | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Web Audio (HTMLAudioElement) | web, electron | `src/player/playback/web-backend.ts` |
| Native audio (Capacitor plugin) | capacitor-ios, capacitor-android | `src/player/playback/native-backend.ts` |
| Desktop native audio bridge | electron | `electron/preload/native-audio.ts` + `electron/main/native/audio/` |
| Tauri desktop audio | tauri | `src/player/playback/tauri-backend.ts` + `src-tauri/src/desktop_audio.rs` |

Key files:

- `src/player/playback/types.ts` — unified `PlaybackBackend` interface.
- `src/player/playback/backend-factory.ts` — platform-aware backend selection.
- `src/player/playback/tauri-backend.ts` — Tauri command/event playback bridge;
  Tauri uses the web queue controller while native Rust owns audio playback.
- `src/native/audio/` — native audio facade and shared TS types.
- `electron/preload/native-audio.ts` and `electron/main/native/audio/` —
  desktop bridge IPC plus a minimal Node.js `NativeAudioService`
  implementing the base `@aonsoku/audio-contract` playback methods through an
  embedded libmpv backend. `engine-factory.ts` creates `LibMpvAudioEngine`
  through the `MpvPlayer` boundary and the Node-API addon in
  `electron/main/native/audio/libmpv/`. The legacy
  `electron/main/native-audio/` path re-exports the new implementation for
  compatibility. Desktop native playback requires the libmpv addon and dynamic
  library to be available; production packages place them under
  `resources/native-audio/<platform>-<arch>/` with a manifest generated by
  `pnpm native-audio:prepare`. `libmpv-binding.ts` validates packaged
  manifests, uses `process.resourcesPath` in packaged apps, and falls back to
  the source build path for development. During Electron development, the
  source build is preferred over a stale `resources/native-audio` copy;
  packaged apps keep the packaged resource first. Missing native pieces
  produce startup diagnostics and visible `error` events while cache/download
  APIs remain usable. Before the renderer selects native playback, a
  synchronous Electron capability handshake confirms that the binding loaded,
  a throwaway `mpv_initialize` succeeds without registering system commands,
  and the addon exposes the required system-media update/clear methods; a
  failed or missing handshake keeps Web Audio, renderer Media Session, and the
  web queue controller active. This is a binding-capability check, not proof
  that an OS media surface is currently healthy. `make`, `publish`, and
  platform package scripts run strict native audio verification and fail if
  addon/runtime files are missing; development
  `build:unpack` runs the non-strict verifier. The Electron service includes a
  desktop queue engine aligned with the mobile native plugin contract for
  context/user queues, shuffle/repeat, full-state export, scrobble buffering,
  sleep timers, remote playback projection, and a platform-scoped system
  adapter for HUD/like integration. `NativeAudioService` serializes all
  playback and queue mutations through one FIFO shared by renderer IPC,
  system-media commands, playback-ended advancement, sleep timers, and state
  restore; queue-driven nested loads use private non-enqueuing helpers to avoid
  deadlocks. Asynchronous engine failures join the same FIFO, settle buffering,
  playback, scrobble, persistence, and renderer state once per service load
  generation, and stale queued failures are ignored after a newer load begins.
  The engine event contract does not expose libmpv playlist-entry ids, so an
  old-source error first delivered after a new load has already begun cannot be
  distinguished at the service boundary. A failed queue load restores the
  command's pre-mutation queue and source snapshot before later commands run,
  while read-only and download/cache APIs remain outside the playback FIFO.
  Desktop native playback also owns Subsonic now-playing and scrobble
  submission in the main process. The playback FIFO only settles playing
  segments into the persistent `DesktopScrobbleBuffer`;
  `DesktopScrobbleSubmitter` uses the existing native bridge
  credential/request path asynchronously, applies the mobile threshold
  (`min(duration * 50%, 240s)`), and retries pending entries in order on ready
  or later playback opportunities. Each play has a stable entry id so a
  successful retry removes exactly that play even when the same song appears
  more than once. The renderer `useScrobble` hook remains active only for Web
  Audio, including Electron fallback, as gated by
  `shouldUseNativePlaybackBackend()`.
  Special desktop volume behavior: the
  Electron bridge keeps the mobile `setSystemVolume` method name for contract
  parity, but it controls only the embedded player/libmpv volume and must not
  change the user's OS output volume. See `docs/native-audio-libmpv.md` for
  build, smoke-test, packaging, diagnostics, and release details.
  The Node-API addon publishes active libmpv playback directly to each desktop
  system media surface: `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` on macOS, SMTC on Windows,
  and MPRIS2 over the session D-Bus on Linux. Do not rely on the renderer Web
  Media Session for desktop native-audio registration; the renderer disables
  `navigator.mediaSession` via `shouldUseNativePlaybackBackend()`
  (`src/utils/setMediaSession.ts`) whenever the native backend owns the system
  media session, so the addon/plugin is the single source of truth. On macOS
  `electron/main/index.ts` also appends `disable-features=HardwareMediaKeyHandling`
  before `app.whenReady()`: Chromium's `HardwareMediaKeyHandling` feature (on by
  default for audio-playing Electron apps) otherwise claims the macOS Now Playing
  slot and routes Control Center / media-key commands to its own
  `RemoteCommandCenterDelegate`, starving the addon's `MPRemoteCommandCenter`
  handlers (play/pause, scrubber, and media keys stop firing). With it disabled
  the addon is the sole media session owner. On macOS the
  addon also registers `MPRemoteCommandCenter` handlers (required for Control
  Center / Now Playing visibility and media-key routing) and forwards system
  media commands back to JS as `system-media-command` events; these flow
  through `LibMpvAudioEngine` to `NativeAudioService.#handleSystemMediaCommand`,
  which applies seek/play/pause/toggle/next/previous directly to local playback
  (matching the desktop taskbar chrome's `handleRemoteCommand` path) so the
  system scrubber and media keys take effect without a main-process -> renderer
  -> main-process round-trip. `like`/`shuffle` still forward to the renderer as
  `remoteCommand` events (their state is owned there), and remote-control
  projection routes commands to the controlled device instead of acting
  locally. Remote projection metadata is also published through the Electron
  main-process engine even though coordination itself is native-owned. Native
  player instances own their last global system-session publication: teardown
  only clears a session still owned by that instance, and command-handler
  detachment precedes player/TSFN destruction so old or finalized players
  cannot clear or call into a newer owner. Windows routes SMTC transport
  buttons (play/pause/next/previous) back to JS the same way, but the classic
  `SystemMediaTransportControls`
  API has no seek/scrubber command, so Windows position changes are
  display-only; Linux routes MPRIS Player method calls (play/pause/playpause/
  stop/next/previous/seek/setposition) back to JS through the same dispatcher,
  advertises only the capabilities it can prove from the active track and
  command handler (queue-bound next/previous remain false), exposes a fixed
  playback rate of 1.0, validates `SetPosition` track ids and bounds, and emits
  `Seeked` only after the async seek is reflected back into the native media
  state. It answers `Get`/`GetAll` for both the Player and Root interfaces with
  a full introspection XML. MPRIS `Stop` dispatches the shared native stop
  command, which clears local playback; `OpenUri` is unsupported. The addon
  reads `artworkUrl` from
  `NativeAudioMetadata`: on macOS it asynchronously fetches the image and sets
  `MPMediaItemArtwork` (cached per-URL, stale downloads are ignored); on Linux
  it exposes `mpris:artUrl`. Linux accepts only a cached local `file://` URI and
  omits artwork on a cache miss so authenticated Subsonic URLs and replayable
  credentials are never published on the session bus. Platform artwork
  consumers cannot resolve the renderer's `aonsoku-media://` custom protocol,
  so `electron/main/core/events.ts` wires an `artworkUrlResolver`
  into the desktop audio service that translates `aonsoku-media://getCoverArt`
  URLs (renderer-driven loads) and bare cover-art ids (queue-driven loads) into
  a safe local cached file for Linux or authenticated Subsonic HTTP URLs on
  macOS/Windows before metadata reaches the engine. The
  service also re-syncs the system media session's elapsed time after a seek
  so the Now Playing scrubber stays accurate between play/pause updates.
  Windows sets the SMTC `Thumbnail` from the resolved HTTP `artworkUrl` via
  `RandomAccessStreamReference::CreateFromUri`, letting the OS fetch the
  image. Linux builds require
  the system `dbus-1` development package in addition to libmpv headers.
- `src/player/queue-controller/` — queue management
  (`web-controller` / `native-controller`). Runtimes with native playback
  support, including Electron when the desktop bridge is available, attempt the
  native controller first and fall back to the web controller on construction
  failure.
- `src/store/player/playback-actions.ts` — runtime-aware action dispatch.
- `src/utils/capabilities.ts` — runtime detection and capability matrix.

### CI Native Audio Builds

The Electron build/release/nightly GitHub Actions workflows compile the libmpv
Node-API addon on every target platform/arch through the reusable composite
action `.github/actions/setup-native-audio`. It installs or fetches libmpv
development files, runs `pnpm native-audio:build`, stages the runtime
libraries into `resources/native-audio/<platform>-<arch>/`, and runs
`pnpm native-audio:smoke:packaged` before the Electron build.

- **macOS**: `brew install mpv`; `scripts/native-audio/ci/collect-runtime-darwin.mjs`
  walks the `otool -L` closure of `libmpv.2.dylib`, copies the Homebrew dylib
dependency set into a staging directory, rewrites their install ids and
cross-references to `@loader_path/<name>`, and patches the addon's libmpv
reference. The x86_64 build runs on `macos-15-intel` (the last GitHub-hosted
Intel runner; `macos-13` is retired) and the arm64 build on `macos-latest`.
- **Windows**: `scripts/native-audio/ci/fetch-libmpv-windows.mjs` downloads the
`mpv-dev-<arch>` and `mpv-<arch>` archives from `shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake`,
stages the runtime DLLs, and generates an MSVC-compatible `mpv.lib` import
library from `libmpv-2.dll` with `dumpbin`/`lib` (via `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd`).
The `electron/node-gyp` fork is archived (2025-10-11) and pinned via a git
tarball, so it never gained Visual Studio 2026 (version 18) support; current
GitHub Actions Windows runners (`windows-latest`, `windows-11-arm`) resolve to
the `win25-vs2026` image. `build-addon.mjs` therefore invokes the idempotent
`scripts/native-audio/ci/patch-node-gyp-vs2026.mjs` on Windows before spawning
node-gyp, backporting the VS 2026 / `v145` toolset detection from upstream
nodejs/node-gyp 69e5fd2 into the installed `@electron/node-gyp`
`find-visualstudio.js` in place. The Linux addon's `$ORIGIN` rpath is
single-quoted in `binding.gyp` (`-Wl,-rpath,'$$ORIGIN'`) so the shell does not
expand it to empty before the linker records it.
- **Linux**: builds an **audio-only libmpv from source** via
  `scripts/native-audio/ci/build-libmpv-linux.mjs` (meson + ninja, mpv source
  pinned to a release commit SHA in `RELEASE_MPV_VERSIONS` and verified with
  `git rev-parse HEAD` after clone/fetch) with all video output, GPU, display,
  and hardware-acceleration features disabled (`-Dgl/vulkan/egl/wayland/x11/drm/vaapi/vdpau/libplacebo
  =disabled` etc.). The distro `libmpv-dev` / `libmpv2` package is
  intentionally not used because it transitively depends on the graphics
  stack (GL/EGL/Vulkan/X11/DRM/libplacebo), making runtime bundling
  impractical. The audio-only `libmpv.so` only depends on FFmpeg, libass,
  audio output client libs (ALSA + PulseAudio), and base-system libs.
  `scripts/native-audio/ci/collect-runtime-linux.mjs` walks the `ldd`
  dependency closure, copies every non-base-system `.so` into a flat staging
  directory using soname filenames, and applies `patchelf --set-rpath
  '$ORIGIN'` so the bundled libs resolve each other without touching system
  paths. Build deps: `build-essential git meson ninja-build pkg-config
  patchelf libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libavfilter-dev
  libswresample-dev libswscale-dev libass-dev libpulse-dev libasound2-dev
  libdbus-1-dev squashfs-tools`. All three Linux makers (`.deb`, `.rpm`, AppImage) bundle
  the audio-only libmpv runtime closure and declare **no** libmpv-related
  package dependency. They do declare a **glibc baseline dependency**
  (`depends: ["libc6 (>= 2.35)"]` / `requires: ["glibc >= 2.35"]` in
  `forge.config.ts`) because CI builds on Ubuntu 22.04 (glibc 2.35). The
  resulting packages require glibc >= 2.35 at runtime.
  Linux CI uses strict `--require-runtime-libs` verification, same as macOS
  and Windows. The `build:linux`, `make`, and `publish` npm scripts also run
  `scripts/native-audio/run-packaged-smoke.mjs --only linux`, so Linux
  local/release paths cover `native-audio:smoke:packaged` (it is a no-op on
  macOS/Windows). On a Linux host targeting Linux,
  `verify-libmpv-package.mjs` additionally invokes
  `scripts/native-audio/linux-runtime-linkage.mjs`, which runs `ldd` and
  `readelf -d` on the addon and every bundled `.so`: no dependency may be
  `not found`, every bundled `.so` must carry a `$ORIGIN` rpath/RUNPATH, and
  the addon's `libmpv.so` must resolve to a path inside the bundle directory
  (proving the `$ORIGIN` bundle is self-contained rather than binding to a
  system libmpv). macOS/Windows and cross-builds skip the deep check. The
  AppImage target (`@reforged/maker-appimage`) is built
  alongside the `.deb`/`.rpm` by `electron-forge make --platform linux` and
  is now self-contained; it shells out to the system `mksquashfs`
  (`squashfs-tools`) and downloads the AppImage type2 runtime at make time.

### Modification Rules

When modifying playback-related functionality, **all stacks must remain
feature-consistent**:

1. Playback logic changes -> update both `web-backend.ts` and
   `native-backend.ts` when the behavior applies to both.
2. Queue logic changes -> update both `web-controller.ts` and
   `native-controller.ts`.
3. Playback action changes -> ensure Web/Electron and Capacitor native branches
   are covered in `playback-actions.ts`.
4. New playback features -> define them in the `PlaybackBackend` interface and
   implement/degrade them in all backends.
5. Platform capability differences (`capabilities.ts`) -> degrade gracefully
   when unavailable, never silently ignore.
6. Remote-control or handoff changes -> verify local playback, remote playback
   projection, and native coordination paths.

### Native Player Debug Window (Electron desktop)

A developer/debug window mirroring the mobile `DebugViewController` /
`DebugActivity` (Playback / Info / Logs tabs, 2s auto-refresh). Entry point is
macOS-only, under the View application menu ("Native Player Debug…"); other
platforms have no menu entry yet. The window is a standalone `BrowserWindow`
that loads the dedicated Electron-only renderer entry
`electron/renderer/native-debug/index.html` (not part of the shared `src/` SPA).

- Main-process debug surface lives in `electron/main/native/debug/`:
  `NativeDebugLogger` (ring buffer, mirroring mobile `NativeLogger`),
  `debug-provider` (aggregates `NativeFullState` + libmpv diagnostics +
  credentials + process info + logs into one snapshot), and IPC handlers
  (`aonsoku-native-debug:snapshot|control|clear-logs`). The window itself is
  managed in `native-debug-window.ts`; `NativeAudioService.getDebugExtras()`
  exposes engine diagnostics + the live buffering flag.
- Preload bridge `electron/preload/native-debug.ts` exposes
  `window.aonsokuNativeDebug`; `window.api.openNativeDebug()` opens the window.
- The main native audio stack (`DesktopNativeAudioService`,
  `DesktopQueueEngine`, `LibMpvAudioEngine`) is instrumented with
  `nativeLogger` calls (sources `audio-service` / `queue-engine` /
  `libmpv-engine`) so the Logs tab shows real activity. Avoid logging
  progress events (too noisy).
